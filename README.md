# SpotExplorer - Interactive Image Allocation in Jetpack Compose

Composable function SpotAllocator is a Jetpack Compose Composable function 
that enables interactive image zooming, panning, and marker selection.  
It is designed for mapping locations, seat allocation, object marking, and 
other interactive UI components in Android applications.

## Features
- Pinch-to-Zoom & Pan: Smooth zooming and panning for image navigation.
- Double-Tap Zoom: Quickly zoom into a tapped location.
- Marker Selection & Animation: Select spots with visual feedback.
- Haptic Feedback: Optional vibration for enhanced user interaction.
- Dashed Routes: Connect markers with dashed lines.
- Customizable Overlay & Labels: Optional UI elements for better 
visibility.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Add the SpotAllocator function to your Jetpack Compose project.

### Usage Example
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
    val imageBitmap = loadImage() // Load your image here
    val squares = listOf(
        SquareInfo(Offset(100f, 200f), Color.Red, "A1"),
        SquareInfo(Offset(300f, 500f), Color.Blue, "B2")
    )

    SpotAllocator(
        imageBitmap = imageBitmap,
        squares = squares,
        selectedSquare = null,
        onSquareClick = { square, position, type ->
            println("Clicked: $square at $position ($type)")
        }
    )
}
```

## Customization
SpotAllocator provides various options to customize behavior and visuals:

| Parameter        | Type             | Default  | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| `imageBitmap`   | `ImageBitmap`    | Required | The image displayed in 
the background. |
| `squares`       | `List<SquareInfo>` | `emptyList()` | List of markers 
on the image. |
| `selectedSquare` | `SquareInfo?`    | `null`   | The currently selected 
marker. |
| `markerSize`    | `Float`          | `80f`    | The size of markers. |
| `useOverlay`    | `Boolean`        | `false`  | Dark overlay on the 
image. |
| `useVibration`  | `Boolean`        | `true`   | Enables haptic feedback 
on selection. |
| `useAnimation`  | `Boolean`        | `true`   | Enables marker 
animations. |
| `animationOption` | `Int`          | `1`      | Animation style (1, 2, 
or 3). |
| `showText`      | `Boolean`        | `true`   | Shows text labels for 
markers. |
| `showDashRoute` | `Boolean`        | `true`   | Draws dashed lines 
between markers. |
| `onSquareClick` | `(SquareInfo?, Offset?, String) -> Unit` | - | 
Callback for taps and selections. |

## How It Works
1. Loads an image (`ImageBitmap`) and displays it as the background.
2. Allows user interaction via zoom, pan, double-tap zoom, and tap 
gestures.
3. Displays selectable markers (`SquareInfo`) that can animate and change 
state.
4. Handles marker selection and triggers a callback with tap position & 
selection state.
5. Supports overlays & route drawing between multiple selected markers.

---

## Example Marker Selection
```kotlin
onSquareClick = { square, position, type ->
    when (type) {
        "tap" -> println("Marker Selected: $square")
        "long" -> println("Long Press at: $position")
    }
}
```

## Upcoming Features
- Multi-touch Gesture Support (Pinch-to-Zoom, Drag) [Completed]
- Marker Grouping & Clustering
- Marker Editing (Add/Remove dynamically)
- Customizable Marker Shapes
- Image Cropping & Region Selection
- Live GPS Integration
